I am not responsible for anything in any way, and just used this as a place to upload files to support the tales of visual debugging as of http://ronubo.blogspot.co.il/2016/02/visual-remote-debugging-of-huge-native.html

Wish I could test them properly, you can help by downloading the .cproject and .project files to your AOSP directory, import project and be 
patient...
